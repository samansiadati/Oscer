# Relation Extraction model

This repository is for Oscer.ai and the purpose of it is Relation Extraction. **Relation Extraction** is the task of predicting attributes and relations for entities in a sentence. For example, given a sentence “Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.”, a relation classifier aims at predicting the relation of “bornInCity”. Relation Extraction is the key component for building relation knowledge graphs, and it is of crucial significance to natural language processing applications such as structured search, sentiment analysis, question answering, and summarization.

In the ./models/ folder, you can see 4 Python files : 

**1- model.py**: main class of your model

**2- train.py**: script to train the model.

**3- test.py**: script to run model on test set

**4- pipeline.py**: a pipeline to use your trained model to detect relations
